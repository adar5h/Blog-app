6. Refactored code with the usage of memoization and callbacks to improve the codebase's readability, maintainability, and performance.
7. Developed comprehensive test cases, including functional tests and integration tests, following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to ensure code quality, identify and fix bugs, and maintain application stability.
